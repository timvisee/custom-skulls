Version 0.3
-Vault already covers PermissionsEx, GroupManager, and ZPermissions, with the exception of Permissions 2.0. Having two files to do what Vault already does is redundant: removed PermissionsManager and PermissionsSystemType.
-The copy() method in CustomSkulls is redundant, replaced with saveDefaultConfig().
-Added missing config.yml to Git repository.
-CommandHandler was split into functions based on the subcommand for easier readability and fixes.
-Added command alias: skulls.
-Changed syntax of give to <receiver> <type/player name> [amount] from confusing <player> <type> [amount] [owner].
-If giving a skull with player name "player", it will default to a normal Head.
-Updated Metric to use BukkitTask.
-Remove dropSkull from config.yml, essentially a duplicate of enable.
-There's no reason to pass plugin into the EntityListener and then pass getConfig() in methods.
